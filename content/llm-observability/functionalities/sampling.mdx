# Sampling

Sampling allows you to control what percentage of traces are sent to Confident's observatory. This is useful for high-volume applications where you may want to reduce the amount of data being sent while still maintaining visibility into your system's performance. 

## Configure Sample Rate

Configure the sampling rate by setting the `CONFIDENT_SAMPLE_RATE` environment variable, which represents the percentage of traces that will be sent to the observatory. 

```bash
export CONFIDENT_SAMPLE_RATE=0.5 
```

Alternatively, you can set the sampling rate directly in python code:

```python
import os
from deepeval.tracing import observe

os.environ["CONFIDENT_SAMPLE_RATE"] = "0.5"

# LLM App
@observe(type="agent")
def agent(query: str):
    return "Agent Response"

for _ in range(10):
    agent("Test sampling")  # roughly half of these traces will be sent
```

<Callout type="info">
Traces are sampled at random and the rest are dropped
</Callout>
