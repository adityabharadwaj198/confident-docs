# Environment

The environment feature allows you to specify which environment your traces are coming from. This is useful for separating traces from different environments such as development, staging, or production.

## Setting the Environment

You can set the environment by setting the `CONFIDENT_TRACE_ENVIRONMENT` environment variable.

```bash
export CONFIDENT_TRACE_ENVIRONMENT="staging"
```

Alternatively, you can set the environment directly in your Python code:

```python
from deepeval.tracing import trace_manager

trace_manager.configure(environment="production")
```

The environment value can be any string that helps you identify where your traces are coming from.

## Using Environments in Confident AI

Environments allow you to separate traces without needing different projects. This is useful for:

- Comparing performance between development and production environments
- Isolating test traces from real user traces
- Monitoring different deployment stages within the same project
