# Environment

The environment feature allows you to specify which environment your traces are coming from. This is useful for separating traces from different environments such as development, staging, or production.

## Configure Environment

You can configure the environment with the `CONFIDENT_TRACE_ENVIRONMENT` environment variable. 

```bash
export CONFIDENT_TRACE_ENVIRONMENT="staging"
```

Alternatively, you can set the environment directly in python code:

```python
from deepeval.tracing import trace_manager, observe

trace_manager.configure(environment="production")

# LLM App
@observe(type="agent")
def agent(query: str):
    return "Agent Response"

my_agent("Test Environment")
```

The `environment` can be any string that helps you identify where your traces are coming from.
