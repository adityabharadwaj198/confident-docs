# Invite Team Members

When team members are invited to a project, they receive access to that specific project only. This includes permissions to use the project's API keys, view and edit project data, and invite additional team members. Other projects within the same organization remain separate and inaccessible to them.

## Invite a New User

Simply go to **Project Settings** > **Team** in your project space, and click on the **Invite Team Member** button.

A dialog will open, where you can enter the email address of your teammate that you wish to grant access to. Once you've entered a valid email address, press **Send Invitation**.

<Callout type="info">
  The user you just invited should receive an email for them to join your
  project. If they don't receive anything, creating an account (or logging in)
  with the email address they were invited with **WILL ALLOW THEM TO JOIN THE
  PROJECT** upon authentication.
</Callout>

## Accept an Invitation

The user you've invited **does not** have to have an existing account with Confident AI. All they have to do is:

1. Login or create an account **WITH THE EMAIL ADDRESS THEY WERE INVITED WITH**. This can be through Google auth as well in the login page.
2. Upon authentication, they will be prompted to join your project. Click **Accept**.

<Callout type="warning">
  If the user accepting the invitation already belongs to **another
  organization**, they will be removed from all projects and organizations they
  belong to in order to join your project under your organization.
</Callout>

If you accidentally declined the invitation, reachout to support@confident-ai.com.
