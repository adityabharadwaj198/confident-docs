# Sign Up or Login to Confident AI

## Create an Account

If you don't already have a Confident AI account, visit [app.confident-ai.com](https://app.confident-ai.com) and create one. You can create an account using your email address or through Google authentication for a faster process.

Only **work** email addresses will be accepted.

## Complete Onboarding

After creating your account, you'll be guided through the onboarding process:

- Create an organization with a descriptive name
- Provide your name
- Select your preferred data residency region
- Configure any additional settings specific to your use case

This information helps us customize your experience and ensure compliance with your data requirements.

> [!NOTE]
>
> During onboarding, Confident AI automatically creates:
>
> - An organization to group all your projects and team members
> - Your first project within that organization
>
> As your team grows, you can:
>
> - Create multiple projects to organize different LLM use cases
> - Add team members to specific projects they need access to
> - Keep data separate between projects for better organization and security

## Copy Your API Key

The last step of the onboarding allows you to copy your **project** API key. This key is all that is needed to use Confident AI with DeepEval.

Keep this key secure, as it provides access to your project data on Confident AI through DeepEval.
