# This is Just the Beginning

All the steps in the previous sections are probably the simplest evaluation workflow you can setup and very likely your LLM application is a lot more complicated than what we've shown.

This section will go through how to get the most out of Confident AI, and offer some points and hand you off into other parts of the documentation where you might have questions for.

## Other Things You Should Do

You should also:

- [Create and version](/prompt-management/introduction) your prompts in **Prompt Studio**.
- [Log hyperparameters](/llm-evaluation/evaluation-features/parameter-insights) during evaluation for parameter insights.
- [Unit-test in CI/CD](/llm-evaluation/evaluation-features/unit-testing-in-cicd-in-cicd) pipelines to run evals pre-deployment
- [Setup notifications](/project-settings/integrations) to get notified when evaluations complete
- [Setup more LLM tracing](/llm-tracing/introduction) to debug nested components, like retrievers and tool calls, especially for agents
- [Online metrics](/llm-tracing/tracing-features/online-evaluation) to monitor real-time performance
- [Talk to us](https://discord.gg/3SEyvpgu2f) to validate whether the metrics you've chosen are approrpiate for your use case


## Important Disclaimers To Note

In this quickstart, there are important things to take notice of:

- You can use [any custom LLM judge](https://deepeval.com/guides/guides-using-custom-llms) as evaluation model when running evals **locally**
- You can run evaluations using Confident AI's LLM judges when running evals **on the cloud**
- You should **DEFINITELY** put more time into [choosing the right metrics](/concepts/metrics#choosing-the-right-metrics) and not blindly use the `AnswerRelevancyMetric`
- You should analyze whether your dataset has good enough [test coverage](/dataset-editor/analyzing-test-coverage)
