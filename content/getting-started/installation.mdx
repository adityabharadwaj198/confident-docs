# Install DeepEval

## Setup A Python Environment (recommended)

Go to the root directory of your project and create a virtual environment (if you don't already have one). In the CLI, run:

```bash copy
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

## Run `pip install deepeval`

In your newly created virtual environment, run:

```
pip install -U deepeval
```

## Login (Again) With Your API Key

By now, you should have your Confident AI API key from following the [instructions on the previous page](/getting-started/create-account). You'll need to log in with that API key in DeepEval to ensure all evaluations, datasets, and prompts stay in sync with your project on Confident AI.

To log in with your API key, run the following command in the CLI:

```bash
deepeval login --confident-api-key YOUR_API_KEY
```

Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with the API key you copied from the Confident AI dashboard.

> [!NOTE]
>
> You can also login by using the `login_with_confident_api_key` method without going through the CLI if you're in a notebook environment:
>
> ```python
> deepeval.login_with_confident_api_key("YOUR_API_KEY")
> ```

Once logged in, you're ready to start using Confident AI with DeepEval for your LLM evaluations.
