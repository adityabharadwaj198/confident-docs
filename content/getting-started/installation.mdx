# Install DeepEval

## Setup A Python Environment (recommended)

Go to the root directory of your project and create a virtual environment (if you don't already have one). In the CLI, run:

```bash copy
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

## Run `pip install deepeval`

In your newly created virtual environment, run:

```
pip install -U deepeval
```

## Login (Again) With Your API Key

By now, you should have your Confident AI API key from following the [instructions on the previous page](/getting-started/create-account). You'll need to log in with that API key in DeepEval to ensure all evaluations, datasets, and prompts stay in sync with your project on Confident AI.

To log in with your API key, run the following command in the CLI:

```bash
deepeval login --confident-api-key YOUR_API_KEY
```

Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with the API key you copied from the Confident AI dashboard.

> [!NOTE]
>
> You can also login by using the `login_with_confident_api_key` method without going through the CLI if you're in a notebook environment:
>
> ```python
> deepeval.login_with_confident_api_key("YOUR_API_KEY")
> ```

Once logged in, you're ready to start using Confident AI with DeepEval for your LLM evaluations.

### Set your data region (if required)

Confident AI's data lives in the US by default, but if you're a customer with a data residency in the EU, you'll need to run this command to point `deepeval` to use Confdient AI's API endpoints on our EU servers and databases instead:

```bash
deepeval confident-set-url EU
```

This step is only required if you've created an account in the EU data region. For more information on data residency, [click here.](/data-handling#data-residency)

## What's Next?

In the next section, we'll quickly setup a prompt and dataset on Confident AI, so that we can start running LLM evaluations.
