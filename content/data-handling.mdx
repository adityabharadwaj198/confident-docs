# Everything on Data Related Issues

This page goes through everything data related, including how data is organized and separated, privacy, residency, etc. on Confident AI.

## Data Organization and Separation

When you initially create an account on Confident AI, an **organization** and a **project** within that organization are automatically created for you. Each organization can have multiple **projects** and **users**.

<Callout>
  You should create a separate project for each distinct [LLM use
  case](/llm-use-cases), even when multiple use cases share the same codebase or
  business logic. This is because the datasets and metrics will be different for
  each use case.

As your organization scales, you can:

- Invite more **users** to your **project** (they have access to project data)
- Invite more **users** to your **organization** (they don't have access to project data yet)
- Create more **projects** within your **organization**

All data (test case data, metrics data, dataset data, tracing data, etc.) **is separated at the project level**. Users from one project cannot access data in projects they don't belong to, even if they are within the same organization.

### Organization

An organization represents the top-level container for all your Confident AI resources. Subscription plans and billing cycles are managed at the **organization** level. For example, if you subscribe to the [Premium plan](https://confident-ai.com/pricing), all **projects** within your organization will automatically receive premium features.

### Project

Projects function as separate workspaces within your organization where data and access permissions are isolated. They allow different teams or use cases within your organization to maintain distinct LLM evaluation workflows.

<Callout type="info">
  After completing the initial onboarding process once you've [created an account](/getting-started/setup#create-an-account), you will be the sole **user** belonging to your **project** within your **organization**.

## Data Residency
