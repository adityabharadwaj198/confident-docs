# LLM Red Teaming for Enterprise

> [!NOTE]
>
> LLM Red Teaming is currently in beta. We're actively developing this feature and welcome feedback from early adopters.

Confident AI pentration tests your LLM system for model and system weaknesses that can lead to safety and security vulnerabilities such as bias, toxicity, PII leakage, and misinformation. This is done through DeepTeam, a framework built on top of DeepEval but dedicated for red teaming LLMs.

[DeepTeam is open-source](https://github.com/confident-ai/deepteam), and we encourage everyone to [get started with DeepTeam](https://trydeepteam.com) before considering Confident AI's enterprise offering.

## Enterprise Offering

If you decide red teaming is a good fit for your organization after trying out DeepTeam open-source, Confident AI's enterprise offering on red teaming instantly brings a managed red teaming strategy to your entire organization, from engineers to security officers.

### Professional Support

Our founding team behind DeepTeam will help develop customized attack strategies optimized for accuracy and reliability. We use rigorous evaluation metrics to validate both the effectiveness of attack simulations and your LLM's responses to these attacks. Through thorough research analysis tailored to your specific use case, we ensure attacks reliably expose real vulnerabilities while minimizing false positives. We provide comprehensive guidance to help you build secure and reliable AI applications that meet your organization's security requirements, backed by quantitative assessment of attack success rates and defense effectiveness.

### Automated Vulnerability Scanning

Automatically detects your LLM applications for common vulnerabilities, including prompt injection, data leakage, and harmful outputs. Our system uses advanced techniques to identify potential security gaps before they can be exploited, and anyone from your organization can easily customize any specific vulnerability requirements.

### Custom Attack Simulation

Simulate adversarial attacks on 10+ attack methods. Our platform allows security personnel, legal compliance teams, and engineers to write and customize attacks by hand - including prompt injection, jailbreaking attempts, and other security threats. These custom attacks are first simulated in a safe environment before being used to test your LLM application's defenses against real-world exploitation scenarios.

### Continuous Monitoring

Stay protected with continuous monitoring of your LLM applications in production. Our system automatically evaluates live LLM outputs against red teaming metrics to detect vulnerabilities, bias, and safety issues in real-time. Set up custom alerts to be notified immediately when potential threats emerge, allowing you to take swift action before issues impact users.

### Detailed Reporting

Access comprehensive risk assessments and trust centers that provide full transparency to both internal and external stakeholders. Our detailed reporting includes:

- Historical vulnerability trends and mitigation progress
- Severity ratings and potential business impacts
- Recommended remediation strategies
- Compliance status tracking
- Stakeholder-specific dashboards for security, engineering and management teams

### Compliance With Industry Guidelines

Our red teaming framework aligns with industry standards and best practices, including the OWASP Top 10 for Large Language Model Applications:

1. **Prompt Injection**: Protection against malicious prompts that could manipulate model behavior
2. **Insecure Output Handling**: Prevention of harmful or unintended model outputs
3. **Training Data Poisoning**: Detection of potential training data contamination
4. **Model Denial of Service**: Safeguards against resource exhaustion attacks
5. **Supply Chain Dependencies**: Monitoring of third-party model and data dependencies
6. **Sensitive Information Disclosure**: Prevention of unauthorized data exposure
7. **Insecure Plugin Design**: Security analysis of LLM plugin architectures
8. **Excessive Agency**: Control of model autonomy and decision-making boundaries
9. **Overreliance**: Balanced implementation of human oversight
10. **Model Theft**: Protection of model intellectual property

Each vulnerability category is continuously monitored and tested according to the latest security guidelines and best practices.
