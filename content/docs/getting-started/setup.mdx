# Setup Confident AI

Follow this 5 min quickstart guide to start evaluating away.

## Create An Account

If you don't already have a Confident AI account, visit [app.confident-ai.com](https://app.confident-ai.com) and create one. You can create an account using your email address or through Google authentication for a faster process.

  If you wish to **sign in using SSO**, checkout our [enterprise
  offering.](https://confident-ai.com/pricing)
</Callout>

After creating your account, you'll be guided through the onboarding process. You'll find your API key at the last step of the onboarding. allows you to copy your **project** API key. Keep this key secure, as it provides access to your project data on Confident AI through DeepEval.

<summary>How are my data separated on Confident AI?</summary>

During onboarding, Confident AI automatically creates:

    - An organization to group all your projects and team members
    - Your first project within that organization

As your team grows, you can:

    - Create multiple projects to organize different LLM use cases
    - Add team members to specific projects they need access to - Keep data separate between projects for better organization and security

For more information, on how data is separated and organization is structured, [visit the data handling page.](/docs/data-handling)

## Install DeepEval

### Create virtual enviornment

Go to the root directory of your project and create a virtual environment (if you don't already have one). In the CLI, run:

```bash copy
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

### Run `pip install deepeval`

In your newly created virtual environment, run:

```
pip install -U deepeval
```

### Provide API key

To log in with your API key, run the following command in the CLI:

```bash
deepeval login --confident-api-key YOUR_API_KEY
```

Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with the API key you copied from the Confident AI dashboard.

> [!NOTE]
>
> You can also login by using the `login_with_confident_api_key` method without going through the CLI if you're in a notebook environment:
>
> ```python
> deepeval.login_with_confident_api_key("YOUR_API_KEY")
> ```

Once logged in, you're ready to start using Confident AI with DeepEval for your LLM evaluations.

<summary>How to switch my data region to EU?</summary>

Confident AI's data lives in the US by default, but if you're a customer with a data residency in the EU, you'll need to run this command to point `deepeval` to use Confdient AI's API endpoints on our EU servers and databases instead:

```bash
deepeval confident-set-url EU
```

This step is only required if you've created an account in the EU data region. For more information on data residency, [click here.](/docs/data-handling#data-residency)
