# Assign Goldens

For bigger teams with multiple annotators, you can assign team members to annotate or review goldens through the **Golden Editor** (click on the pencil icon at the leftmost of each golden row).

The team member will automatically get an email notifying them of the golden(s) they have been assigned.
