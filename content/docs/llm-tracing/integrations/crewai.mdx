# CrewAI

[CrewAI](https://www.crewai.com/) is a lean, lightning-fast Python framework for creating autonomous AI agents tailored to any scenario.

## Quickstart
Confident AI provides a `instrumentator` that can trace CrewAI's execution with just a single line of code.

Install the following package:
```bash
pip install -U deepeval
```

With your Confident API key, initialize DeepEval's `instrumentator` in your agent's `main.py` script:

```python filename="main.py" showLineNumbers {3}
from deepeval.integrations.crewai import instrumentator

instrumentator(api_key="<your-confident-api-key>")
```
That's it! You can now see the traces on Confident AI's **Observability**.
