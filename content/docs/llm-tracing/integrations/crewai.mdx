# CrewAI

[CrewAI](https://www.crewai.com/) is a lean, lightning-fast Python framework for creating autonomous AI agents tailored to any scenario.

## Quickstart
Confident AI provides a `instrumentator` that can trace CrewAI's execution with just a single line of code.

Install the following package:
```bash
pip install -U deepeval
```

With your Confident API key, initialize DeepEval's `instrumentator` in your agent's `main.py` script:

```python
from deepeval.integrations.crewai import instrumentator
instrumentator(api_key="<your-confident-api-key>")
```
That's it! You can now see the traces on Confident AI's **Observability**.

## Basic CrewAI Agent

Here's a basic example of a CrewAI agent with Confident AI's `instrumentator`:

```bash
pip install crewai
```

```python filename="main.py" showLineNumbers {3, 8}
from crewai import Agent, Task, Crew
import os
from deepeval.integrations.crewai import instrumentator
import time

os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "<your-openai-api-key>"

instrumentator(api_key="<your-confident-api-key>")

# Define your agents with roles and goals
coder = Agent(
    role='Consultant',
    goal='Write clear, concise explanation.',
    backstory='An expert consultant with a keen eye for software trends.',
)
 
# Create tasks for your agents
task1 = Task(
    description="Explain the latest trends in AI.",
    expected_output="A clear and concise explanation.",
    agent=coder
)
 
# Instantiate your crew
crew = Crew(
    agents=[coder],
    tasks=[task1],
)

# Kickoff your crew
result = crew.kickoff()
print(result)

time.sleep(7) # Wait for traces to be posted to observatory
```

Run your agent:

```bash
python main.py
```
After execution, you can see the traces on Confident AI's **Observability**.
