# PaydanticAI

[Paydantic AI](https://ai.pydantic.dev/) is a platform for building and deploying AI agents. It provides a set of tools and libraries for building and deploying AI agents.

## Quickstart
Confident AI instruments PydanticAI to trace your agent's execution and achieve observability. 

```bash
pip install pydantic-ai sdk -U deepeval
```

With your Confident API key, setup the instrumentaion in your agent:
```python filename="main.py" showLineNumbers {6, 10}
import os
import time
from pydantic_ai.agent import Agent
from deepeval.integrations.pydantic_ai import setup_instrumentation

setup_instrumentation(api_key="<your-confident-api-key>")

os.environ['OPENAI_API_KEY'] = '<your-openai-api-key>'

Agent.instrument_all()

agent = Agent(  
    'openai:gpt-4o-mini',
    system_prompt='Be concise, reply with one sentence.',  
)

result = agent.run_sync('Where does "hello world" come from?')  
print(result.output)

time.sleep(10)
```

Run your agent:

```bash
python main.py
```

After execution, you can see the traces on Confident AI's **Observability**.
