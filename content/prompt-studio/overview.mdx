# Prompt Studio Overview

Confident AIâ€™s **Prompt Studio** allows you to create and version different versions of your prompts. This allows you to:

1. Collaborate and centralize where prompt is stored and edited, even for non-technical team members
2. Use it within your LLM application
3. Pinpoint which version, or even combination of your prompt versions, performs best

There are million places you can keeping your prompts - on GitHub, CSV files, in memory in code, Google Sheets, Notion, or even written in a diary hidden under your table drawer. But only by keeping on prompts on Confident AI can you fully leverage Confident AI's evaluation features.

<Callout type="info">
  Prompts are a type of hyperparameter on Confident AI. Other
  [hyperparameters](/concepts/hyperparameters) include things like models,
  embedders, top-K, and max tokens. By running evaluations using the same
  prompts that kept on Confident AI, we can tell you which version performs
  best, and later automatically optimize it for you.
