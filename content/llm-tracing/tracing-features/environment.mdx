# Environment

The environment feature allows you to specify which environment your traces are coming from. This is useful for separating traces from different environments in `"development"`, `"staging"`, or `"production"`.

## Configure Environment

You can configure the environment with the `CONFIDENT_TRACE_ENVIRONMENT` environment variable. 

```bash
export CONFIDENT_TRACE_ENVIRONMENT="staging"
```

Alternatively, you can set the environment directly in code:

```python showLineNumbers {3}
from deepeval.tracing import observe, trace_manager

trace_manager.configure(environment="production")

@observe()
def llm_app(query: str):
    return openai.ChatCompletion.create(
        model="gpt-4o",
        messages=[
            {"role": "user", "content": query}
        ]
    ).choices[0].message["content"]


llm_app("Write me a poem.")
```

The `environment` can be either `"production"`, `"staging"`, or `"development"`, and helps you identify where your traces are coming from.
