# Threads

A "thread" on Confident AI is a group of one or more traces. This is useful for those building AI chatrooms, conversational agents, etc., where you wish to view entire conversations on Confident AI.

<Callout type="warning">
It is traces that are grouped together, not spans.
</Callout>

## Set Threads At Runtime

You can use the `update_current_trace` function to set the `thread_id` within traces, which Confident AI will use to group traces together:

```python showLineNumbers {12}
from deepeval.tracing import observe, update_current_trace
 
@observe()
def llm_app(query: str):
    res = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
        model="gpt-4o",
        messages=[
            {"role": "user", "content": query}
        ]
    ).choices[0].message["content"]

    update_current_trace(thread_id="your-thread-id", input=query, output=query)
    return res
 
llm_app("Write me a poem.")
```

The `thread_id` can be any string, and the `input` and `output` is optional and simply gives you more control on what is displayed on the UI. 

<Callout>
If the I/O is not provided, it will be set to the [default I/O values of the trace.](/llm-tracing/tracing-features/input-output#set-trace-io-at-runtime)
