# Users

You can track user interactions with your LLM app by setting the `user_id` in a trace. This allows you to track things such as how much tokens each user is costing you, who interacted with your LLM app the most, etc.

## Set Users At Runtime

You can use the `update_current_trace` function to set the `user_id` within traces:

```python showLineNumbers {12}
from deepeval.tracing import observe, update_current_trace
 
@observe()
def llm_app(query: str):
    res = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
        model="gpt-4o",
        messages=[
            {"role": "user", "content": query}
        ]
    ).choices[0].message["content"]

    update_current_trace(user_id="your-user-id")
    return res
 
llm_app("Write me a poem.")
```

The `user_id` can be any string, including the actual IDs of customers in your own database, or even their email addresses. Everything will be viewable and searched in the UI.
