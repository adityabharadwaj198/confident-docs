# Create From Test Runs

Sometimes, you may already have [ran an evaluation](/llm-evaluation/running-llm-evals) and have existing test runs on Confident AI. 

To create a dataset from an existing test run, go to **Evaluation** > Select a test run to go to an individual **Test Run** page > **Test Cases**, and click on the **Save as new dataset** button.

This doesn't mean it is too late to create a dataset, but instead makes life easier as you can create a dataset out of an existing testing report, and later reuse this dataset to standardize the benchmarking of all future iterations of your LLM application.
